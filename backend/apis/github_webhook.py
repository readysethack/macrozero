    Verify that a webhook payload was sent by GitHub using HMAC signature validation.

    GitHub signs webhook payloads using the webhook secret configured in the app.
    This function validates the signature to ensure the request is authentic and
    hasn't been tampered with.

    Args:
        raw: The raw request body bytes (before any JSON parsing)
        sig_header: The X-Hub-Signature-256 header value from the request

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 
        - 403 if signature header is missing or invalid
        - 500 if webhook secret is not configured

    Security:
        - Uses constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
        - Requires the webhook secret to be configured in environment
        - Must be called with the raw request body, not parsed JSON

    Usage:
        raw_body = await request.body()
        verify_signature(raw_body, request.headers.get("X-Hub-Signature-256"))

    Handle incoming GitHub webhook events for pull requests.

    This function processes webhook payloads from GitHub, validates their authenticity,
    and performs automated actions based on pull request events.

    Args:
        request: FastAPI Request object containing the webhook payload

    Returns:
        dict: Response indicating the processing status and action taken

    Security:
        - Verifies webhook signature using HMAC-SHA256

        - "opened": New pull request created
        - "reopened": Previously closed PR was reopened  
        - "synchronize": New commits pushed to existing PR

    Actions Performed:
        - Posts an acknowledgment comment on qualifying PRs
        - Can be extended to trigger CI, code analysis, etc.

    Usage:
